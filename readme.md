Simple chatting application made using Django. Here users are added to some groups. User can send a query in that group, reply to a query and can reply to a reply as well. We have used two models Groups and Messages and for stroing user details we have used the default user model of the django framework. One for group which has a many to many relation with the User model. The message group has a foreign key relation with the Group model which tells that from which group this message belong. There is another foreign key linking between User model and Messages model which tells that from which user sent this message. Then for implementing reply part, we have created a foreign key self linking field which is null by default. If a user reply to some message then that message get linked to the replied message throgh the reply field. The replied message will contain the foreign key reference to the message for which it has been replied. 

We also have made UI for the project. The first page will be a login page and when user login he will be taken to chatting home page which will contain all his groups and messages. He can send a new message to the groups or can reply to any message.
